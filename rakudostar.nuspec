    <summary>This is Rakudo Star, a useful, usable Perl 6 distribution</summary>
    <description>A useful and usable production distribution of Perl 6

The Rakudo Star distribution (aka Rakudo *) combines a Rakudo Perl 6 compiler with additional resources including a selection of modules.

This chocolatey package defaults to the MoarVM.</description>
    <releaseNotes># Announce: Rakudo Star Release 2017.04

## A useful and usable production distribution of Perl 6

On behalf of the Rakudo and Perl 6 development teams, I'm pleased to
announce the April 2017 release of "Rakudo Star", a useful and usable
production distribution of Perl 6. The tarball for the April 2017 release
is available from [https://rakudo.perl6.org/downloads/star/].

Binaries for macOS and Windows (64 bit) are also available.

This is the seventh post-Christmas (production) release of Rakudo Star and
implements Perl v6.c. It comes with support for the MoarVM backend (all module
tests pass on supported platforms).

This release includes "zef" as module installer.  "panda" is to be shortly
replaced by "zef" and will be removed in the near future.

It's hoped to produce quarterly Rakudo Star releases during 2017 with 2017.07
(July) and 2017.10 (October) to follow.

Please note that this release of Rakudo Star is not fully functional with the
JVM backend from the Rakudo compiler. Please use the MoarVM backend only.

In the Perl 6 world, we make a distinction between the language ("Perl 6") and
specific implementations of the language such as "Rakudo Perl".

This Star release includes [release 2017.04.3] of the [Rakudo Perl 6 compiler],
version 2017.04-53-g66c6dda of [MoarVM], plus various modules, documentation,
and other resources collected from the Perl 6 community.

[release 2017.04]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rakudo/rakudo/2017.04/docs/announce/2017.04.md
[Rakudo Perl 6 compiler]: http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo
[MoarVM]: http://moarvm.org/

The Rakudo compiler changes since the last Rakudo Star release of 2017.01 are
now listed in "2017.02.md" and "2017.04.md" under the "rakudo/docs/announce"
directory of the source distribution.

In particular This release featured many important improvements to the IO
subsystem thanks to Zoffix and the support of the Perl Foundation.

Please see
Part 1: http://rakudo.org/2017/04/02/upgrade
Part 2: http://rakudo.org/2017/04/03/part-2
Part 3: http://rakudo.org/2017/04/17/final-notes

Note there were point releases of 2017.04 so also see "2017.04.1.md",
"2017.04.2.md" and "2017.04.3.md".

Notable changes in modules shipped with Rakudo Star:

    + DBIish: New version with pg-consume-input
    + doc: Too many to list. Large number of "IO Grant" doc changes.
    + json\_fast: Too many to list. Big performance improvements.
    + perl6-lwp-simple: Fix for lexical require and incorrect regex for absolute URL matcher
    + test-mock: Enable concurrent use of mock objects
    + uri: Encoding fixes
    + zef: Too many to list. IO fixage.

There are some key features of Perl 6 that Rakudo Star does not yet
handle appropriately, although they will appear in upcoming releases.
Some of the not-quite-there features include:

  * advanced macros
  * non-blocking I/O (in progress)
  * some bits of Synopsis 9 and 11

There is an online resource at [http://perl6.org/compilers/features]
that lists the known implemented and missing features of Rakudo's
backends and other Perl 6 implementations.

In many places we've tried to make Rakudo smart enough to inform the
programmer that a given feature isn't implemented, but there are many
that we've missed. Bug reports about missing and broken features are
welcomed at rakudobug@perl.org.

See [https://perl6.org/] for links to much more information about
Perl 6, including documentation, example code, tutorials, presentations,
reference materials, design documents, and other supporting resources.
Some Perl 6 tutorials are available under the "docs" directory in
the release tarball.

The development team thanks all of the contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Star possible. If you would like to contribute, see
http://rakudo.org/how-to-help, ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org
mailing list, or join us on IRC \#perl6 on freenode.
